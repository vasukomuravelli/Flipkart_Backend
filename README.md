# Flipkart_Backend
Integrated the backend to the existing Flipkart clone in 4 days with the team of 6 people. We have created our own API using the tech stacks Node JS, Express JS, MongoDB data base, and for the deployment of server we have used Heroku. Added Auth validation for adding products to cart, accessing the Wishlist, and for Checkout by generating a token during signup and login using JWT package.

## Tech stacks used :

* html,
* css, 
* javascript.
* Node JS
* Express JS
* MongoDB
* Slick Slider, an external CSS library.

## Authentication Page: 

 This page accepts basic details of user and registers the user onto our server and when the user logins with incorrect credientials it will sent an alert for incorrect credentials.

 This is the landing page which includes Navbar(login dropdown options changes once user logins, search functionality of the various products on clicking the results redirect to Search Results page, cart which navigates user to cart page), which is common throughout website and also features the various categories of products as carousels.
For building carousel we have used Slick Slider, an external CSS library.

## Product page:

This page contains 2 halves. The first half focuses on the image, and buttons like add to cart, buy now, wishlist & the second half focuses on the details, description & key features of the product. By making decision on purchasing a product this website allows user to use two options buynow(Add product to cart & redirecting to cart page), add to cart(if user wants to checkout with more than one product). Here we are checking the validation of user to add product to cart.
